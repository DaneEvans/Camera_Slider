BLE API Documentation for Camera Slider Firmware
================================================

This directory contains header files that document the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) API
for the Camera Slider firmware. These files are automatically processed by Doxygen
to generate comprehensive API documentation.

Files:
-------

1. `ble_index.h` - Main documentation index and overview
   - Complete API introduction and quick start guide
   - Platform support and getting started instructions
   - Architecture overview and command reference
   - Troubleshooting and development guidelines
   - Examples and additional resources

2. `ble_api.h` - Complete API reference documentation
   - BLE Services available
   - Command definitions and usage
   - Response formats
   - Connection parameters
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Future enhancement plans

3. `ble_examples.h` - Practical usage examples
   - Python examples using bleak library
   - JavaScript/Web Bluetooth examples
   - iOS Swift examples
   - Testing and debugging examples

How to Use:
-----------

1. **For Developers**: Include these headers in your projects to understand the API
2. **For Documentation**: Run Doxygen to generate HTML documentation
3. **For Integration**: Use the examples as starting points for your applications

Doxygen Integration:
--------------------

These files are automatically included in the Doxygen build because:
- They are in the `include/` directory (specified in Doxyfile INPUT)
- They have `.h` extension (included in FILE_PATTERNS)
- They contain proper Doxygen comment blocks

To regenerate documentation:
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated documentation will be available in `docs/html/index.html`

Current API Commands:
--------------------

- `a` - Move slider forward
- `b` - Move slider backward
- `s` - Get device status (planned)
- `x` - Emergency stop (planned)
- `speed:<value>` - Set speed (planned)
- `pos:<value>` - Set position (planned)

For more details, see the generated Doxygen documentation or refer to the
individual header files.
